## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

bash 
# using npm 
npm start 
# OR using Yarn 
yarn start


### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

#### For Android

bash 
# using npm 
npm run android 
# OR using Yarn 
yarn android

#### For iOS
bash 
# using npm 
npm run ios 
# OR using Yarn 
yarn ios

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

### Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For Android: Press the R key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (Ctrl + M on Window and Linux or Cmd âŒ˜ + M on macOS) to see your changes!
   For iOS: Hit Cmd âŒ˜ + R in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. ðŸ¥³
